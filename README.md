I want to build a Progressive Web Application containing several Single Page Applications.

- docker
- served over https
- needs to contain a service-worker and app manifest

- webpack as a bundler
- gulp as a task runner
- yarn
- react 16 as DOM manipulator and router

external communication
- fetch instead of ajax
- wrapped in a promise
- error handling using throw/try/catch

style
- BEM naming
- css modules (modular css)
- plain css3 (using CSS variables) so no SASS
- css grid (perhaps also flexbox)
- postCSS using autoprefixer

linting
- stylelint
- jslint

unit test
- some way to unit test the JS code

- sourcemaps

furthermore, it would be nice to touch..
- responsive images
- link rel preloading
- font-display
- feature queries
- media queries
- some array reducer functions (reduce, filter, map, push)
- some object manipulators and typechecking
- time/datetime notatie
- aria-label's, tabindex, aria follow of hoe dat ook heet
- use object literals
- use closure
- spread operator
- use stateless functional components
- use queryselector
- put js onderin html
